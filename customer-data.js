Actual lead and lag time for variable duty and information transfers may be allowed (eg. due to excessive commute time, etc.) as long as effective communication and coordination occurs in order to maintain 24/7 service as required.

The safety value of an accident or an incident is largely proportional to the quality of the investigative effort. As Navigation Services would not normally be named as an official party to an accident investigation it does not maintain a trained accident investigation team. However, the risk management process does establish the requirements to internally investigate reported incidents and other safety reported issues using the Issue Reporting System. 

Internal Incident Investigations. Most incidents or occurrences do not warrant investigations by either the State investigative or Regulatory authorities. Nevertheless, such incidents may be indicative of potentially serious hazards—perhaps systemic problems that will not be revealed unless the occurrence is properly investigated. Navigation Services must investigate all navigational related incidents involving aircraft equipped with its delivered flight procedures. 

Incidents or issue reports that are disclosed to a regulator or other issues as deemed appropriate will be reviewed by the OSQT to determine if a more complete investigation is warranted. This investigation would go beyond what is completed during the Safety Risk Analysis and reporting process. If this investigation is required it will be completed by the Flight Path Services Leader or another trained investigator identified by the OSQT. 

Actions resulting from investigation recommendations are to be recorded in the SMS/QMS database, and monitored for effectiveness.
